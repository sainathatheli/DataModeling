How to capture data change?

Data Change in the dimension tables can be captured using following methods

Method 1 : SImple pass Through Dimension -->Truncate and load the data

Method 2 : Slowly Changing Dimension

Method 1: SImple Pass Through Dimesion
    -->Used to load current data after truncating the target table
    -->Doesnt filter out the existing rows,load all the source rows
    --> Data flow for all existing rows in the source

Method 2 : Slowly Changing Dimension
History of data can be maintained in three different types:

TYPE 1: Changed data overwrite the existing data and history in not maintained
   
TYPE 2 : Flag- Changed data is added as a new record  and history is maintained using flag
       
      -->Version - Changed data is added as new row and history is maintained using
		 version number
      -->TimeVariant - Changed data is added as new record and history is maintained using
		time stamp

TYPE 3 : Changed data is added as new column and history is restrited to previous data
          and  current data



Meta data:
===========
Metadata is defined as data about data.

Metadata in a DWH defines the source data i.e FlatFile,Relational Database and other objects.

Metadata  is used to define which table is source and target and which 
concept is used to build logic called transformation to the actual output.
